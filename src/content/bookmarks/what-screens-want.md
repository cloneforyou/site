A visual essay about the screen (and the web) as a media and as an abstraction. Specifically, the author notes that abstractions emphasize details that matter for those for whom it was created, downplaying and blurrying everything else. With that in mind, it's easy to see that our abstraction for the web comes from the corporate, surveillance-oriented, centralized web. That it is the reason why it is important to remember that 'the map is not the territory', and our abstractions are not one with what they aim to represent.
