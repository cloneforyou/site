> In today’s attention economy, ideas don’t need to be deleted or redacted to be silenced. They can be drowned out privately, screen by screen, by unchecked noise from decoy bots, doxxing campaigns, and filter bubbles.

Yet another critique to our current state of affairs on the attention economy. Specifically, our endless anxiety-driven timeline scrolling to keep up with the news and gossips is very akin to Huxley's Brave New World dystopia: it's not about burning books or hiding truths (as in Orwell's 1984), but about rendering them useless, everybody being way too distracted (one may say busy) to be interested on them.
